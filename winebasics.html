    <h2>Red Wine 101</h2>
    <p>
      Red wine is made by fermenting dark grapes with their skins. This gives the wine its color, flavor, and structure. From bold and full-bodied to light and fruity, red wines come in many styles.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Wine Terms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tannins</strong> â€“ The dry, puckery feel from grape skins</li>
      <li><strong>Body</strong> â€“ How heavy or light the wine feels in your mouth</li>
      <li><strong>Acidity</strong> â€“ The crispness and freshness of the wine</li>
      <li><strong>Finish</strong> â€“ How long the flavor lasts after swallowing</li>
    </ul>
